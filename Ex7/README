purposes.

# Runtime Analysis #

1. is_prime - if n <= 1 the function returns. Else it returns 
the value of the recursive helper function, which in the worst case will run
 n/2 times until i == 1,
therefore we have O(n/2).
2. print_no_repetition_sequences - the main function calls the recursive
function, which has a loop that runs until i = len(char_list), and the last
statement is when we still did not print all words, the recursive function is
called again n times on the sliced list, Therefore we have O(n**2).
3.flood_fill - the main function runs the recursive helper function, which
 in the worst case, e.g. empty dot in the middle of image with all 2
  horizontal and 2 vertical directions empty, will runs the 4 ifs to fill all
   directions, and each if runs the recursive function again, thus
    we have O(n**4).
