Description:
This exercise we defined 9 function to carry out mathematical operations,
using different operators such as +,-,*,**,/,>,<,!=, and different functions
 defined with print,split,if,else,return.

Special comments:
Function 9 is the function that tests function 4. I used values ranging from
(-3, -2, -1) to (1, 2, 3) adding 1 every time. I picked these values because
they cover every possbile combinations: all numbers are negative,
2 negative and 1 zero, 1 negative zero and 1 positive, one zero and 2
positive, 3 positive. This covers every possible combination of numbers
inserted to the function.
